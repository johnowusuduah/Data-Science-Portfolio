### About
I am an engineer who values making a shift from the prevailing anecdotal, political and social way of making decisions within organizations to a more precise, evidence-based data-driven process which can be replicated and scaled in a cost effective manner.

## Projects

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/johnowusuduah/ds_portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
